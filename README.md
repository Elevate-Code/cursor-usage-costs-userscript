-   **Interactive Hourly Chart:** Adds an interactive chart that visualizes your usage costs by the hour, helping you spot spending patterns instantly.
-   **Dynamic Summary:** Provides a clear summary line that shows the total cost and date/time range for the usage events currently visible in the table.
